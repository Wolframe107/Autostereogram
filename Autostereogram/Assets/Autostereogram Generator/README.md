# Autostereogram Generator

Welcome to the Autostereogram Generator! This tool creates autostereograms by using a depth map to displace the underlying 3D object seen from the camera.

## How to Use
1. Attach the provided script to your desired **camera** in the scene.
2. Adjust the variables to customize the effect to your liking.

## Tips for Optimal Results
- **Avoid High Displacement Values:** High displacement values may cause artifacts like holes to appear in the output.
- **Experiment with Variables:** Fine-tune the available variables to minimize artifacts and achieve the desired effect.
- **Use different texture** You can use any texture, but make sure you set it to Read/Write.

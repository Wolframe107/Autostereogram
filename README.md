# Autostereogram Generator
![Example](Autostereogram/Screenshots/git_cover_2025-01-23_16-50-20.jpg)
This project is a Unity-based tool that lets you generate autostereograms in real-time using a custom shader.

Warning, the images get weird artifacts sometimes when too high displacement values are chosen. Not sure why...

## Features
- **Real-time generation**: Create and tweak autostereograms dynamically.
- **Shader-based implementation**: Uses a custom shader to render the effect efficiently.
- **Unity compatibility**: Developed in Unity 2022.3.36f, ensuring a modern and stable development environment.

   ```
2. Open the project in Unity 2022.3.36f or later.
3. Press Play to explore the real-time autostereogram generator.

## Usage
